I'm Tricia Tan, a senior software engineer in Singapore. This blog is mostly for me to put my learnings down in writing.
My working style is to always stay humble and curious about tech.

If you agree with [37 signals](https://37signals.com/), then we'll probably be good friends.

If you'd like to chat more, please email me hello@triciatzy.com. I'll be delighted!
